# Learning Python

These are the notes I've taken while learning how to code in Python. I
decided to write everything up and put them on Github more as a backup
than anything else.

Notes and exercises taken from [here](https://python.swaroopch.com/modules.html).

## strange.py

This was a function I found on Reddit that recreates the climax to the
Doctor Strange movie using recursion. I decided to write it out because
I found it entertaining while showing me an example of what a Python
function looks like. At the time I'd had very little experience using
Python or reading it.
